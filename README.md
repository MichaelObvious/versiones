# Versiōnēs

texts translated by Michele Palese.

**Warning: files that are flagged as `\*.original\*` are not my property, those texts were not written by me, they are only the original from which I translated.**

## Compile & get the PDFs

You need to have [python](https://www.python.org/), [xelatex](https://www.latex-project.org/) and [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) in your system and in the `PATH` variable.

If you want to get the PDFs (they will be in `builds/pdf`)

```console
$ python3 scripts/build.py pdf
```
If you want to get the Markdown version (they will be in `builds/md`)

```console
$ python3 scripts/build.py md
```
